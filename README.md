# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.java` file contains code that causes this exception. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version.

The issue stems from incorrect array indexing, attempting to access an index that doesn't exist within the array's bounds.

This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java to avoid runtime exceptions.
